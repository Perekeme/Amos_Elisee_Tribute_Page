     These elementary-level tools help kids learn to code by targeting
      the foundations of programming: problem-solving, logic, and
      critical thinking. Some of the tools on this list focus on simple,
      block-based coding, while others use real text-based languages; 
      a few of the tools even incorporate both to help kids with the transition to more advanced projects.
      By learning these skills through the context of code, 
      kids build essential 21st-century skills for life that empower them to become creators, not just consumers, of the technology.
